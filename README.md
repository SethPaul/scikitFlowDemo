# Scikit-Learn work flow demo
This demo will be revisiting the Kaggle Titanic dataset

We'll be introducing some new tools to implement what we did last session. Using custom classes (regressors, classifiers, cluster-ers, transformers, feature unions, and pipelines) can be powerful additions to your tool belt.

This introduction is modeled after Adam Rogers's titanic_finished-ish.py script we worked through last time.

Data available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.
